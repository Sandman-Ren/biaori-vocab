## Modal Implementation Details

### Animation System
The modal uses a sophisticated animation system built on Framer Motion:

#### Entrance Animation
- **Scale**: Grows from 90% to 100% size
- **Opacity**: Fades in from 0 to 1
- **Position**: Slides up 20px during entrance
- **Timing**: Spring physics (300 stiffness, 30 damping)

#### Exit Animation
- **Scale**: Shrinks from 100% to 90% size
- **Opacity**: Fades out from 1 to 0
- **Position**: Slides down 20px during exit
- **Timing**: Matches entrance animation for consistency

#### Backdrop Animation
- **Opacity**: Independent fade animation (200ms duration)
- **Blur**: Backdrop blur effect for focus isolation
- **Non-blocking**: Page remains interactive during animations

## Bug Fixes

### Critical Animation Bug (Fixed)
**Issue**: Modal overlay remained active during close animation, blocking all page interactions.

**Root Cause**: Attempted manual animation control by keeping modal mounted with `isModalClosing` state.

**Solution**: Implemented proper Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` pattern:
- Moved `AnimatePresence` to parent component
- Used unique keys for proper animation triggering  
- Simplified modal component to standard motion patterns
- Eliminated blocking overlay states

**Result**: Smooth animations without interaction blocking.
