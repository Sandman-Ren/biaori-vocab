## Modal Implementation Details

### Animation System
The modal uses a sophisticated animation system built on Framer Motion:

#### Entrance Animation
- **Scale**: Grows from 90% to 100% size
- **Opacity**: Fades in from 0 to 1
- **Position**: Slides up 20px during entrance
- **Timing**: Spring physics (300 stiffness, 30 damping)

#### Exit Animation
- **Scale**: Shrinks from 100% to 90% size
- **Opacity**: Fades out from 1 to 0
- **Position**: Slides down 20px during exit
- **Timing**: Matches entrance animation for consistency

#### Backdrop Animation
- **Opacity**: Independent fade animation (200ms duration)
- **Blur**: Backdrop blur effect for focus isolation
- **Non-blocking**: Page remains interactive during animations

### Component Architecture

                ├── Content (scrollable cards)
                └── Footer (action buttons)
```

### CSS Utilities Added
```css
/* Modal Structure */
.modal-overlay { /* Fixed positioning and backdrop */ }
.modal-content { /* Modal container with proper sizing */ }
.modal-rounded { /* Rounded corners with proper border-radius */ }
.modal-scroll { /* Scrollable content area */ }
.modal-footer { /* Footer styling and layout */ }

- **Screen Reader**: Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels
- **Focus Management**: Focus trapping and restoration
- **ESC Key**: Close modal with Escape key
- **Touch**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile

### Copy Functionality

- **Offline Support**: Cache modal content for offline viewing
- **Print Support**: Print-friendly modal layouts

## Bug Fixes

### Critical Animation Bug (Fixed)
**Issue**: Modal overlay remained active during close animation, blocking all page interactions.

**Root Cause**: Attempted manual animation control by keeping modal mounted with `isModalClosing` state.

**Solution**: Implemented proper Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` pattern:
- Moved `AnimatePresence` to parent component
- Used unique keys for proper animation triggering  
- Simplified modal component to standard motion patterns
- Eliminated blocking overlay states

**Result**: Smooth animations without interaction blocking.

## Development Process
